# Tensorflow DNN-classification
**********
this is a  simple tensorflow dense neural network model to show the tensorflow basics using the tensorflow estimator API.
In order to keep it as simple as possible the dataset used is a simple binary classification csv file with datapoints and 
corresponding (0/1) labels.I wil into each part of the code for better understading.

## Library list:
```
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```
